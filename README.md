# Licence plate recognition in android application

### Context
This is an android application that enables to detect license plates in cars, and recognize the number car plate. The models are two models, one for object detection, that detects the plate number through OCR. The models are integrated into the application, which can work while offline to real time recognition.

### Further training
If you wish to improve the accuracy of the models used, you can create a new labelled dataset through the application itself, as it has a feature to store all its detections (detected image, box coordinates for object detection, detected text), and enables you to correct it and save it in a history panel. Through exporting the corrected data, the accuracy of the model could be very improved.

### Testing
